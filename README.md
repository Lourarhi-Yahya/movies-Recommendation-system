Project: Film Recommendation System

This project involved a team of six individuals working on the development of a film recommendation system based on a database of 100,000 films. Our objective was to create an efficient and accurate recommendation system that could provide personalized film suggestions to users.

Throughout the project, we explored various machine learning models to improve the recommendation accuracy. We implemented and compared several models, including the simple overall average, the Movie effect multi-variate, the Movie and user effect multi-variate, and the Regularized movie and user effect. These models allowed us to capture different aspects of film preferences and tailor recommendations accordingly.

As part of my contribution to the project, I played a key role in visualizing and processing the extensive film database. I worked on data preprocessing tasks, ensuring the data was in a suitable format for training the machine learning algorithms. Additionally, I actively participated in training the models, fine-tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance.

Furthermore, I was involved in building the film recommendation platform. Leveraging my programming skills, I implemented the necessary components and features to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The platform allowed users to input their preferences, view personalized film recommendations, and explore additional information about the recommended films.

This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in processing and analyzing large datasets, implementing machine learning models, and developing recommendation platforms. Collaborating with a diverse team allowed us to exchange ideas, leverage each other's strengths, and collectively tackle complex challenges.

To facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing, we have created a dedicated GitHub repository for this project. The repository contains the code, documentation, and resources used in the development of the film recommendation system. We encourage others to explore the repository, provide feedback, and contribute to further enhancing the system's performance and user experience.

By sharing our work on GitHub, we aim to contribute to the broader community of machine learning enthusiasts, foster collaborative learning, and inspire the development of advanced recommendation systems.
